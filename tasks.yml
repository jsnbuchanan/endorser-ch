  - .5 Android confirmation-loading spinner is invisible
  - 01 Figure out why "fetch" doesn't retrieve the most recent data. (Test by scanning a QR code to load contacts in bulk, and see that you don't get the new contents when you change something in that remote CSV.)
  - see other bugs below
- 02 in text search -  remove any results without text after DIDs are hidden (because that means the matching data was a DID that the user shouldn't see)
- 01 fix subjects (eg. Jun 29 2019 claims by me for others)
- 02 show signatures for proof of confirmations
- 02 the number in the green result might not always be a JWT ID so we should label the entity type (to help with debugging)
  - ... and add confirmation IDs for confirmation claims
- 04 fix infura.io "legacy access request rate exceeded" (esp. in tests for ethr-did-resolver)
  - may be due to SimpleSigner in controller.js and https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-jwt/blob/937973e31d4bee3ee32dd1e077f11d31b6b868cb/README.md#1-create-a-did-jwt

  - 01 add a way to retrieve all DIDs that can see me
    - 01 add a way from the mobile app to audit all the DIDs that can see me
  - 02 get review from professional - useEffect & useFocusEffect calls
    - See especially scannedDatum passed to Contacts.tsx, where I don't understand how to goBack without remembering the params and why other combinations didn't work (eg. useEffect, setting scannedImport in the useState). (Note that a code change causes a reload and then the useFocusEffect will run again. Not a problem, just indicates a suboptimal design.)
  - document (eg enhancements to key derivation)
  - publish on F-Droid
  - 01 add Android 'release' build in the process
  - .2 change verbiage from "hide" & "not visible" to "blocked"?
  - type:CorrectAction when multiple "Can ... see me?" or "double-check" buttons are hit, often at least one of the spinners never stops

- 01 fix network - if a DID with "*" tries to disallow, throw error
- 04 export to Neo4J
- 32 switch/add format to verifiable credentials?

- 01 gotta report errors to user (eg. unrecognized context URL or claim type in createWithClaimRecord result)
- 01 gotta report errors to user (eg. "encoded" instead of "jwtEncoded", no event found, repeated action claim submitted)
- 02 gotta report errors to user
  - eg. repeated or failed confirmations so should see mix of successes and errors
  - eg. remove hashHex column and see how parts succeed but there's still an error
  - ... and guard every API call in uport-demo with a response.ok check & error catch (and loader)
- 01 in SignClaim, set to confirmations & choose some, set to Join action, set to confirmations again and see that the list is not refreshed
- 01 usability - add a "waiting" spinner when remote method is called
